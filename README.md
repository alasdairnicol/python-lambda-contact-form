# python-lambda-contact-form

This is a contact form for my site https://al.sdair.co.uk/contact/
using Python and AWS Lambda.

It uses the [Chalice][1] microframework to manage deployment.

## Instructions (WIP)

### Verify your from-email address

AWS requires that you verify the from email address. See [the docs][2]
for more info.
